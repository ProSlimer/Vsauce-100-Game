# Vsauce-100-Game
This was a challenge provided to me by an instructor.
The goal is to recreate the game in this video:
  Vsauce2 - A Game You Can Always Win - https://youtu.be/dUXW3Kh_kxo
  
An added challenge was to create 3 diffirent difficulties:
  #level 1: computer makes random guesses
  #level 2: computer makes random guess until 50 and then moves to optimal strategy.
  #level 3: the computer always plays optimal strategy.
